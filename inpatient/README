This is is a sample project, demonstrating how to use Prawn gem and Prawnto plugin to produce elegant PDF documents in a Ruby on Rails project.

According to <a href="http://github.com/sandal">Gregory Brown</a>, <a href="http://github.com/sandal/prawn">Prawn</a> is a PDF writing library for Ruby designed to be tiny, fast, and nimble, just like the majestic sea creature.

Despite that Prawn library provides robust PDF creation functionality, it is not specifically targeted toward Ruby on Rails. For example, Prawn lacks of ability to use CSS & HTML for easy styling, which is something most web developers are much more comfortable with from experience. In response to this, <a href="http://github.com/thorny-sun">thorny-sun</a> developed <a href="http://github.com/thorny-sun/prawnto">Prawnto </a>, a rails plugin that provides a Rails application easy access to prawn library. The main advantage of Prawnto is that it provides a template handler that is accessible through a .prawn extension. The .prawn template helps render PDF documents as Rails views.
